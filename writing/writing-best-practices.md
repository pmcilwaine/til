# Document Writing Best Practices

***Thoughts on how to write documents and how to present them at meetings***

Our proposal process involves the group review of a short document followed by a discussion. The document is called a proposal because it usually involves a new idea which needs buy-in / agreement from stakeholders. The idea of presenting the proposal in written format is so that the discussion can be an informed one, with all the knowledge and thought process of the proposal author already understood before the first word is spoken. This document is a collection of best practice guidelines for writing and presenting proposals.

## Set your goal and structure your doc

What is the purpose of the doc? Decision point? Status update? Deep dive into a particular aspect of a project or feature? What are the key questions you're trying to answer? A proposal to present a new service idea would look very different to a proposal to make a decision about one particular feature of that service. Example: "I want to present a new service and get approval for a pilot. I'lI need to show customer need, market opportunity and business case, risks, and an estimate of effort, timeline, and resources required."

## Focus Your Thoughts

State the purpose of your doc at the beginning, what you will and will not cover, and be clear at the beginning of each section what it is you're presenting. If you need to present a lot of details to support your case, consider appendices. Also consider what conversations you do and do not want to have. Your meeting could start late and you don't have time for rat holes. If you don't want to talk about it, don't include it in the doc. This is not about hiding anything; it's about planning your time. Example: *"Overall*

*in 2020, NewFeature1 is expected to drive $X in revenue and achieve adoption of Y%. Please see Appendix A for a full financial model."*

## Structure Your Narrative

Lay out the story. Break your story into sections. Go painfully far in teasing apart what's really going on, separating each element, describing each element clearly and separately, and logically flowing from one element to the next *("At a high level, NextFeature allows users to do X. Specifically, first they do A, then they do B, then C. This allows their end users to experience D").*

Make sure each section can stand on its own and is complete. As you review each section ask yourself: Do I believe this? What argument or data point is missing? Is there room for debate on this point? Think hard about the most obvious questions and objections and bake info relevant to that into the doc. Build your case as you go. Make sure each section builds on the last leading up to your conclusion. Litmus test: are you convinced? If you don't buy your own story, certainly nobody else will.

## Present recommendations, not just problems

Clearly state your recommendation. If the goal of your doc is to present a decision point, make a recommendation. While there are gray areas, you should have an opinion of what you'd do and be able to explain / defend it. Example: *"Should we expose an 800# for support? Strong arguments either way, but I propose not doing SO for X, y, Z reasons."*

## Use data and judgment

Support your assertions with data. If you say "we should do x" follow it immediately with "because of Y and Z." Make sure you're confident in the data you're presenting! (If you think your data has holes, but has value and is still useful, you'd better to point out the holes yourself, than have someone else do it for you during the discussion). Where you are relying upon judgment because the necessary data isn't available state this and the thinking that leads you to your conclusion.

## Consider your audience and anticipate

Put yourself in your audience's shoes and anticipate what information you have VS. need / want to offer. More is not always better, and even though you've been knee deep in detail, present only the salient ones. Example: you're presenting to leadership about overall status on your new service: "Our architecture for NewServiceY comprises six component services that provide back-end storage, message queuing, and various customer interfaces. Please see Appendix C for a brief summary of each. A full operational review will be completed within the next 4 weeks." Communicate that you've done some of your systems homework and that you'll have more details in a full review. Your audience likely won't care about which cable connects where for the purposes of this meeting.

## Wording: choose wisely

Use simple, clean, clear language. According to the Encyclopedia Britannia, the English Language has over a half a million words. Be careful which ones you choose. There is a significant difference between a "manifesto" and a "white paper" Choosing the wrong word (in a narrative or in a discussion) can lead the conversation away from your point. Ask yourself, is this word the right word? Can I back up the use of this word (for instance "many") with data? If SO use the data. Avoid using superlatives

## Visual structure

You don't want just a bulleted list, but bullets and other formatting can be extremely useful to guide the reader through your doc. Bold font, underline, italics, even spacing can be very useful. Someone should be able to scan and quickly understand the story you're going to tell.

## Be Brief

Proposals are narrative documents not PowerPoint decks. If you think a diagram is useful, by all means include it, but your doc should be a story (not an outline with bullet points). Try hard to squeeze your thoughts into 1 page, and if necessary 2 or 3 pages maximum. Use appendices (as many as you need) for additional data which breaks the narrative flow.

## Use your back pocket

Your appendix should include data that is needed to support your narrative. You should not expect your audience to read your appendix. Separate from your appendix make sure you've got an amply filled but not distributed "back pocket." This is the "I-don't-think-we'll-go-there, but-just-in-case-we-do" file

## Bring Data!

Essentially anything that might be needed. And make sure you know what's in it. Example: You're presenting an operational review for a new service. Your doc will summarize test results (pass / fail, key limitations, etc.), and maybe extract some key data in the appendices. In your back pocket, you should have a full list (or encyclopedic memory) of every test you ran, test specs (load, environments, etc.) their numerical results, the issues you found and addressed. Details matter: leave enough time to edit, edit, edit

Phrasing, spelling, and grammar matter. A chef could cook a great meal, but if it looks terrible on the plate, people won't eat it. This is not as easy as just relying on spell check ("two" and "too" are both words, after all). Read your own doc several times. Start generally to get to the content right, then read again for flow and clarity, finally a pass for spelling and grammar. After you've re-read and re-written it twenty times your eyes may not pick up on errors. At that point you should either read it aloud or ask someone else to proofread it. Better yet, save some fresh eyes who know your target audience and get them to do a final read through or two.

## The Meeting

The meeting to discuss your document is more important than the words you have written in the document. Here are some best practices on how to prepare and run the meeting.

### Don't go it alone

Consider who's going to be in your meeting. Who might have interesting insights or helpful suggestions that can make the document stronger? As a rule you probably don't want anything in your doc to come as a surprise to your manager. Also consider who else should be on board before you take this up the chain. The last thing you want to have happen is to have someone in the audience Say “I know nothing about this and can't support it." On the other hand, if you know there are people who are skeptical of your initiative it could be very valuable to include their perspective in your doc and them in the meeting. That way if your initiative moves forward, they will be more able to disagree and commit.

### Communicate the Agenda

Sure, you can send around the doc in advance, but don't expect that all (or anyone) will have read it by the time the meeting comes around. When all are in the room, you set the agenda and expectations: purpose of the meeting, and how you want to run it (e.g. "Meeting today is about X. Please read the doc and then let's talk through Y and Z. The goal for today is to have a decision for each before we're done"). Note: format could also be a read through followed by Q&A, if you don't have a specific decision point If there's a hot button issue that isn't relevant to this meeting, say so: "It will also be important to discuss blah, but we'll do so in a separate meeting as our time today is limited."

### Marshall The Time

You should assume this is the only meeting that will discuss your document, do not waste the meeting time, and do not waste your attendees time. The group will spend the first 10-15 minutes reading quietly after which time the discussion begins. Don't talk while your audience is reading. Don't be afraid to politely shut down discussions on tangents and redirect the conversation back to the main topic. People understand you have an agenda to get through. Be an active participant - the doc is just the first expression of your thoughts. And if someone's asking a question, listen carefully, and answer it directly. Yes / No, and here's why / why not (vs. talking around the question or answering a different question altogether) And if you don't know the answer, just say so.. This is much better than making something up or dancing around it. Take notes on anything you can't answer - and then make sure you follow up (over email or otherwise).
